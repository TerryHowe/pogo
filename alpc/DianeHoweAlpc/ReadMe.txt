Steps to compile and run the various sections of the Art & Logic Programming
Challenge.

Part 1:
I chose to do Part 1b.  This took almost 5 hours.  

The resulting file is called search.html.

Part 2: 
This took about 4.5 hours to implement.  I chose to do the program
in C++ (and wished I chose Java because of all the great string functions
inherent in Java).

There is a makefile to compile this.  Simply type make.

There is also a "test" program that is named tryParser which runs through 
the public methods and asserts on expected results.

Part 3: 
Shows the debugged program in fixedProgram.c.  This can be compiled
in a Linux distro using "make fixedProgram".  This took about 75 minutes
to complete.

Part 4:
The Part4 directory contains a text file with answers to the questions posed.  
This section took almost 1 hour to complete.
